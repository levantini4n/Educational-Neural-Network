It should be noted however that the framework is currently using the central difference theorem rather than actual back propagation

# Helper Material

Clueless about how neural networks work? Use the Manim animation engine to get an `mp4` out of the Python code in *./scene* illustrating the neural network implemented in *example.zig*.

If you are on NixOS, and using flakes, just:
- `cd *scene*`
- `nix develop`
- Follow instructions that get printed out to the terminal
